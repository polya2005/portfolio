# SPAID: The Star Pointing and Identification Device

This project is the second version of this [first, proof of concept version](/project/spaidv1).

## Some background
In the first version's writeup, I wrote

Then, I listed the hardware used. That brings us to the first updates in this version.

## Changes

### Hardware / electronics
I keep all the choices I made except
- Replacing Arduino Mega with Raspberry Pi Pico,
- Storing the star data in LittleFS instead of a micro SD card,
- Using more robust NEMA17 stepper motors instead of 28BYJ-48 ones (and changing stepper drivers accordingly)
- Removing the IR keyboard in favor of on-screen keyboard, and
- Ordering a professionally made PCB for reliable connections.

### Enclosure
I am also working on a new design to accommodate the new motors and make the device more robust.

### Software
The code is almost a complete rewrite because the original code was poorly structured and because I made some questionable decisions. The new code will be described in the next section. I also switched to PlatformIO.

## Project structure
This project follows the standard PlatformIO project structure. The libraries are described below.

| Library | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `AstroCalculator` | A singleton class for coordinates conversion and earth magnetic field calculation. |
| `Datatypes` | `struct` types for coordinate systems. |
| `DeviceCoordinates` | A class that represents motor positions and supports conversions to and from the real horizontal coordinates. |
| `Matrices` | A 3x3 matrix class |
| `MovementController` | A singleton class for motor control |
| `Sensors` | A singleton class for sensor access. Includes accelerometer, magnetometer, and GPS. |
| `TempDebug` | A header file to quickly toggle print statements. |
| `Vectors` | A 3D vector class. |
